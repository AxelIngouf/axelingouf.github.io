			Hey! I'm Axel Ingouf, I'm currently a Game Programming student at Isart Digital Montréal since October 2020,
			where I managed to directly integrate the second year of the course of study without going through the first.
			Before that I graduated from a French "DUT" degree, and went one year in an Engineer School before realising programming video games was my thing.
			<br/><br/>
			I'm an artificial intelligence and new technology enthusiast that might worship Cyberpunk style a bit too much. I fell in love with Unreal Engine 4 on first sight,
			and can't wait to put my hands on Unreal Engine 5!

		<h2>SKILLS</h2>
		<div class="detailed">
		I'm fluent both in C/C++ and Java, but also have some knowledge of web languages like javascript (JQuery) and PHP,
		even though I'm not planning to continue learning web programming for now.<br/><br/>

		Thanks to my curiosity and all the courses I had throughout my studies, I could oversee a lot of computer science fields (and master some of them),
		mainly Object-Oriented Programming, web development, databases, network, versioning (git, svn and Perforce) and even assemblers.

		<br/><br/>
		During this last year at Isart Digital Montréal, I had the opportunity to specialize in video games related development.
		From improving my skills in OOP and network, to learning whole new ones, like animation programming, physics,
		memory management and 3D game engine programming, which is our final project graduation.

				The game I'm the most proud of yet. The Loony Bin is part of a 4 days hackathon project, the Isart Game Week 2021 with a team of 2 programmers,
				3 3D artists, 2 game designers and 1 sound designer.
				
				Our goal was to make a game on the theme of "Generation". So we came up with this horror game taking place
				in a randomly generated maze inspired by Amnesia and SCP-087.<br/><br/>

				I mainly worked on the maze generation, with the goal of having a playable level each time you play with all sorts of randomness in the items, rooms,
				lights and decor placement.<br/><br/>
				
				The other programmer, <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/valentin-dol-26493515a">Valentin Dol</a>, worked on other aspects of the game,
				like the light/shadow design, collectibles and even the enemy.
				Most of the 3D and 2D assets were made by our 2 main 3D artists, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/lecossecanna">Anna Le Cossec</a>
				and <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artatmospere">Juliette Sirulnick</a>.
				They were very professionals and I had a lot of fun working with them for a second time.

				First real game I did outside my courses that I actually finished. At the time I wanted to make a game I could play with my friends on the school computers,
				which we eventually did during way to much lunch breaks.<br /><br/>
				The first version was made using an old 2D java game engine made by previous students. And the second version was made using SDL library in C++ because I wanted to train before applying to Isart Digital Montréal.
				<br/><br/>
				Every character can be controlled either by a human or, by an AI. For the AI, I used an A* search algorithm, and it will choose if it goes for the kill or if something more interesting is near.<br/>Obviously, the part where it kills itself was not intended.

				But if one project really got me started in game programming, that's the one.
